      "summary": "The TIM-barrel fold is one of the most versatile and ubiquitous protein folds\nin nature, hosting a wide variety of catalytic activities and functions while\nserving as a model system in protein biochemistry and engineering. This review\nexplores its role as a key fold model in protein design, particularly in\naddressing challenges in stabilization and functionalization. We discuss\nhistorical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark\ncreation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a\nspecial focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate\nthe sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we\nexamine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards\nfunctionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like\nactive site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating\nstructural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based\nstrategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite\nsignificant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has\nbeen proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating\nfunctionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise\nfunctionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that\nsimultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both\nphysical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental\ninsights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme\ndesign and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein\nbiochemistry, biophysics, and design.",

In this study, we developed a universal automated\nworkflow based on machine learning potentials to simulate the dynamic lithium\n(de)intercalation process. With this approach, the staging structural evolution\nof lithium-graphite intercalation compounds and their lithium transport\nbehavior were resolved through molecular dynamics simulations.

The dynamics of carbon layers\nregulate the lithium (de)intercalation positional selectivity, producing\nintermediate states with varying lithium concentrations and distributions\nduring cycling. This facilitates the formation and transformation of stage\nstructures while mitigating residual stress accumulation. A fundamental kinetic\nasymmetry arises between lithium intercalation and deintercalation, driven by\nthe continuous and heterogeneous lithium transport and carbon layer sliding\nduring charge/discharge processes. The carbon defects regulate lithium\ntransport, in which the atomic-scale defects confine intralayer lithium\ntransport and carbon sliding while enabling interlayer transport via dynamic\nlithium trapping/release mechanisms.

These findings provide a detailed microscopic picture of the inner\narchitecture of P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM) microgels, revealing an unexpected\nstructural organization that may be generalized to other copolymer systems and\ncould be promising to tailor microgel design and enhance control of material\nresponsivity.",

      "summary": "Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are\nstill in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques\nremains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the\nmeanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum\ncircuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\nhardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical\nprocessor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor\nexecutes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and\nexpressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant\nmessage-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid\nquantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties\nof liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the\nmessage-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations\ndriven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature\nstructural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings\ndemonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could\ndeliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative,\nsuggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials\nmodeling.",

      "title": "Constructing Generalized Sample Transition Probabilities with Biased\n  Simulations",
      "summary": "In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, accessing transition probabilities\nbetween states is crucial for understanding kinetic information, such as\nreaction paths and rates. However, standard MD simulations are hindered by the\ncapacity to visit the states of interest, prompting the use of enhanced\nsampling to accelerate the process. Unfortunately, biased simulations alter the\ninherent probability distributions, making kinetic computations using\ntechniques such as diffusion maps challenging. Here, we use a coarse-grained\nMarkov chain to estimate the intrinsic pairwise transition probabilities\nbetween states sampled from a biased distribution. Our method, which we call\nthe generalized sample transition probability (GSTP), can recover transition\nprobabilities without relying on an underlying stochastic process and\nspecifying the form of the kernel function, which is necessary for the\ndiffusion map method. The proposed algorithm is validated on model systems such\nas a harmonic oscillator, alanine dipeptide in vacuum, and met-enkephalin in\nsolvent. The results demonstrate that GSTP effectively recovers the unbiased\neigenvalues and eigenstates from biased data. GSTP provides a general framework\nfor analyzing kinetic information in complex systems, where biased simulations\nare necessary to access longer timescales.",

In this work, we introduce FlowBack-Adjoint as a\nlightweight enhancement that upgrades the pre-trained FlowBack model through a\none-time, physics-aware post-training pass. Auxiliary contributions to the flow\nintroduce physical awareness of bond lengths and Lennard-Jones interactions and\ngradients of a molecular mechanics force field energy are incorporated via\nadjoint matching to steer the FlowBack-Adjoint vector field to produce\nlower-energy configurations. In benchmark tests against FlowBack,\nFlowBack-Adjoint lowers single-point energies by a median of ~78\nkcal/mol.residue, reduces errors in bond lengths by >92%, eliminates >98% of\nmolecular clashes, maintains excellent diversity of the AA configurational\nensemble, and produces configurations capable of initializing stable all-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations without requiring energy relaxation.

By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein\nsequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works\nhave shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does\nnot seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for\nprotein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal,\nretrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context\nlearning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure\nconditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2\nuses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context\nordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language\nmodeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and\nbidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring\nvariants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised\nsettings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning\nsequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets.

      "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations are typically constrained to have a fixed\nnumber of particles, which limits our capability to simulate chemical and\nphysical processes where the composition of the system changes during the\nsimulation time. Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal\ngrowth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the\ncomposition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics\nsimulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and\nnucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the\naddition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition\nfunction, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low\nacceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use\na reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute\nparticles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated\ncode implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses\nharmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which\ncan be considered a proxy for the system's chemical potential. The osmotic\npressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of\nideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure\nregulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of\nan electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations\nwould produce.",

      "summary": "The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an\nefficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign\nproblem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms\nbased on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow\ntime can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped\nHubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of\nthis parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original\nintegration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature\nthat facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time\nmodest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential\nergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the\nGeneralized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC\nupdates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from\nergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the\nBoltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed\nregion. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to\nbe larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions\nwhere ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be\nembedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the\npure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within\nstatistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \\times\n6$ spatial lattice at $T/\\kappa = 1/6.4\\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\\kappa = 8.0$ with\nTrotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\\kappa$: hopping parameter).",
